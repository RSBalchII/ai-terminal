# AI-Terminal Shell Features Documentation

This document describes the shell-like features that have been implemented in the AI-Terminal application.

## 1. Persistent Command History

The AI-Terminal now includes a persistent command history feature that stores executed commands across sessions.

### Features
- Commands are stored in a history file (`~/.local/share/ai-terminal/history.txt`)
- History is loaded automatically when the terminal starts
- Duplicate consecutive commands are not stored
- Empty commands are not stored
- History is limited to 1000 entries by default

### Implementation Details
The command history is implemented in the `terminal-emulator` crate in the `command_history.rs` file. The `CommandHistory` struct manages:
- In-memory storage of history entries using a `VecDeque`
- Loading and saving history to a JSON file
- Adding new commands to history
- Searching for commands
- Getting commands by index

## 2. History Navigation

Users can navigate through their command history using the up and down arrow keys.

### Usage
- Press the **Up Arrow** key to navigate to previous commands in history
- Press the **Down Arrow** key to navigate to newer commands in history
- When navigating through history, the current input is saved and restored when exiting history navigation
- Typing any character or pressing Backspace resets the history navigation

### Implementation Details
The history navigation is implemented in the `terminal-ui` crate in the `lib.rs` file. The `TerminalSession` struct includes:
- `history_index`: Tracks the current position in history
- `input_before_history`: Stores the input before history navigation began
- `navigate_history_up()` and `navigate_history_down()` methods for handling navigation

## 3. Tab Completion for File Paths

The AI-Terminal supports tab completion for file paths, making it easier to navigate the file system.

### Usage
- Type a partial file path and press **Tab** to complete it
- If multiple files match, the first match is used
- Directory names are completed with a trailing slash
- Tilde (`~`) is expanded to the user's home directory

### Implementation Details
The tab completion is implemented in the `terminal-ui` crate in the `lib.rs` file. The `TerminalSession` struct includes:
- `handle_tab_completion()` method for handling tab key presses
- `complete_file_path()` method for finding and completing file paths

## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been written for all new functionality:
- Unit tests for the `CommandHistory` struct
- Integration tests for history persistence
- Tests for the `TerminalSession` struct creation
- Tests for basic functionality

To run the tests:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Future Improvements

Possible future enhancements to the shell features:
- Cycling through multiple tab completion matches
- Command history search (Ctrl+R)
- Improved tab completion with context awareness
- Customizable history size limits
- History export/import functionality
