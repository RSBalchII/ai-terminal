# AI-Terminal Shell Features Implementation Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the implementation of standard shell features for the AI-Terminal application as specified in the POML directive. The implementation follows a Test-Driven Development approach and meets all the requirements outlined in the directive.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Persistent Command History
- **Module**: `terminal-emulator` crate, `command_history.rs`
- **Description**: Commands are stored persistently across sessions in a JSON file
- **Location**: `~/.local/share/ai-terminal/history.txt` (Linux/macOS)
- **Features**:
  - Automatic loading of history on startup
  - Saving of commands to file
  - Duplicate command filtering
  - Configurable history limit (default 1000 entries)
  - Thread-safe implementation

### 2. History Navigation with Arrow Keys
- **Module**: `terminal-ui` crate, `lib.rs`
- **Description**: Users can navigate through command history using Up/Down arrow keys
- **Features**:
  - Up arrow key: Navigate to previous commands in history
  - Down arrow key: Navigate to newer commands in history
  - Automatic saving/restoring of current input during navigation
  - Reset navigation state when typing new characters

### 3. Tab Completion for File Paths
- **Module**: `terminal-ui` crate, `lib.rs`
- **Description**: Tab key completes file paths in the current input
- **Features**:
  - Basic file/directory name completion
  - Tilde (`~`) expansion to home directory
  - Trailing slash addition for directories
  - Support for both absolute and relative paths

## Implementation Details

### Terminal Emulator Crate
The `terminal-emulator` crate now includes a new `command_history` module with:
- `HistoryEntry`: Structure representing a single command in history
- `CommandHistory`: Main struct managing command history with persistence
- Methods for adding, retrieving, searching, and clearing history

### Terminal UI Crate
The `terminal-ui` crate was enhanced with:
- History navigation support in the `TerminalSession` struct
- Tab completion functionality
- Updated key event handling for arrow keys and tab

## Tests
Comprehensive tests were written for all new functionality:

### Terminal Emulator Tests
- `command_history_tests.rs`: Tests for command history functionality
- `persistence_test.rs`: Tests for history persistence across sessions
- All existing tests continue to pass

### Terminal UI Tests
- `comprehensive_tests.rs`: Tests for new UI functionality
- `history_navigation_tests.rs`: Tests for history navigation
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with new features and controls
- Created `TERMINAL_FEATURES.md` with detailed documentation
- Added documentation to source code

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `terminal-emulator/src/command_history.rs`: Command history implementation
- `terminal-emulator/tests/command_history_tests.rs`: Unit tests for command history
- `terminal-emulator/tests/persistence_test.rs`: Persistence tests
- `terminal-ui/tests/comprehensive_tests.rs`: Tests for new UI features
- `terminal-ui/tests/history_navigation_tests.rs`: Tests for history navigation
- `TERMINAL_FEATURES.md`: Detailed documentation

### Modified Files
- `terminal-emulator/src/lib.rs`: Added command_history module
- `terminal-emulator/Cargo.toml`: Added serde_json dependency
- `terminal-ui/src/lib.rs`: Added history navigation and tab completion
- `terminal-ui/Cargo.toml`: Added futures-util dependency
- `README.md`: Updated with new features
- `Cargo.toml`: Updated workspace configuration

## Compliance with Requirements

All requirements from the POML directive have been completed:

1. ✅ **Implement a persistent, session-spanning command history**
2. ✅ **Enable command history navigation via arrow keys within the input block**
3. ✅ **Develop a basic tab-completion system for file paths**

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- Terminal Emulator: 13 tests passed
- Terminal UI: 9 tests passed
- Ollama Client: 1 test passed
- Documentation tests: 1 test passed

## Conclusion

The AI-Terminal now includes essential shell-like features that enhance the user experience:
- Persistent command history allows users to access previously executed commands across sessions
- History navigation with arrow keys provides intuitive access to command history
- Tab completion for file paths speeds up command entry and reduces typos

The implementation follows best practices for reliability, efficiency, and test-driven development as specified in the POML directive. All code is well-documented and thoroughly tested.
