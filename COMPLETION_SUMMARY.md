### 2. System Tools Integration (WARP_002) ✅
- Filesystem operations (list, read, search)
- Process management tools
- Network diagnostics (ping)
- Security layer with proper restrictions
- **Result**: 6/6 integration tests passing

### 3. Chat Functionality (WARP_001) ✅
- Ollama server integration verified
- Model loading and switching tested
- Response generation working
- Streaming support functional
- **Result**: Chat system operational

### 4. Python Bridge Integration ✅
- PyO3 bridge initialized successfully
- Tool command parsing implemented
- System tool execution via bridge tested
- Agent pipeline framework ready
- **Result**: 7/7 bridge tests passing

### 5. Spec-Kit Framework ✅
- Complete specification structure created
- 10 feature specifications documented
- Test patterns established
- Validation framework in place
- **Result**: Spec-driven development ready
