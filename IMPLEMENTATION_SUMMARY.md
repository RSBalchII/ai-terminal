# AI-Terminal Frontend Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the AI-Terminal frontend as specified in the POML directive. The implementation follows the specification by creating a terminal-based frontend using Rust with the ratatui and crossterm libraries.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Project Structure
The implementation follows a modular approach with the following crates:
- `terminal-emulator`: Handles command execution and PTY management
- `terminal-ui`: Implements the TUI using ratatui
- `ai-terminal`: Main application entry point

### 2. Core Components

#### Terminal Emulator
- `CommandBlock`: Represents a single command execution with state management
- `PtyExecutor`: Executes commands in a PTY environment and streams output
- `ExecutionEvent`: Events that occur during command execution

#### Terminal UI
- `TerminalSession`: Main UI controller that manages the terminal session
- `AppMode`: Different modes of the application (Chat, Help)
- Block-based I/O system for displaying commands and their outputs
- Keyboard controls for navigation and command execution

### 3. Features Implemented

#### UI Shell
- Main application window using Tauri-style setup (though we used pure ratatui)
- Core TUI with layout for command blocks, input areas, and status bars
- Welcome message and basic UI elements

#### Core Terminal Logic
- Command input capture and execution
- Block-based I/O system to display commands and outputs in distinct blocks
- PTY-based command execution with real-time output streaming
- Command status tracking with visual indicators

#### User Interface
- Interactive terminal interface with keyboard controls
- Scrolling through command history
- Help system with keyboard shortcuts
- Visual feedback for command execution status

### 4. Tests
- Unit tests for command block creation and state transitions
- Tests for PTY executor creation
- Tests for UI component creation

## How to Run
1. Build the project: `cargo build`
2. Run the application: `cargo run`
3. Use F1 for help, F10 to exit
4. Type commands and press Enter to execute

## Next Steps
- Implement command history and tab completion
- Add more sophisticated UI elements
- Implement additional features as specified in the tasks checklist
