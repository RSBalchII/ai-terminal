# External Context Engine (ECE) Project Analysis Report

## 1. Project Overview (The "Why")

The AI-Terminal project is a revolutionary local-first terminal interface inspired by Zellij and Warp Terminal. It functions as an "Externalized Executive Function" for human users, serving as a "Personal Pauline" - a genuine partner in cognitive and creative processes. The project incorporates modern terminal features like panes, tabs, and AI-powered assistance while emphasizing local-first principles to ensure user privacy and data ownership.

The ultimate goal of the AI-Terminal is to augment human cognitive capabilities by providing an enhanced terminal experience that combines traditional command-line functionality with locally-hosted AI-driven assistance through Ollama. It aims to maintain a "Living Narrative" of the user's journey and interactions while prioritizing user privacy through local-first design.

## 2. System Architecture (The "What")

The AI-Terminal application is structured as a Rust workspace with several key components:

### 2.1 Main Application (`ai-terminal`)
The main application (`ai-terminal`) orchestrates the terminal interface, local AI integration, and user interaction. It serves as the entry point and integrates all other components.

Key Responsibilities:
- Application entry point and initialization
- Integration of terminal UI with local AI capabilities
- MCP client management for connecting to local AI tools
- Command routing between traditional execution and AI assistance

### 2.2 Terminal Emulator (`terminal-emulator`)
The `terminal-emulator` handles command execution, history management, and process control.

Key Components:
- `PtyExecutor`: Executes commands in a pseudo-terminal environment
- `CommandBlock`: Represents individual command executions with state management
- `CommandHistory`: Manages command history with persistence

### 2.3 Terminal UI (`terminal-ui`)
The `terminal-ui` provides the visual interface and user interaction components, inspired by Zellij and Warp.

Key Components:
- `TerminalSession`: Manages the overall terminal session
- Layout management for responsive UI with panes and tabs
- Theme system for customization
- Widgets for enhanced interaction (command palette, confirmation dialogs)

### 2.4 Ollama Client (`ollama-client`)
The `ollama-client` interfaces with the Ollama API for local AI capabilities.

Key Components:
- `OllamaClient`: Handles communication with local Ollama service
- Data models for requests and responses
- Conversation history management
- MCP server implementation for exposing Ollama as local tools

### 2.5 Two-Tiered Memory System
The AI-Terminal implements a two-tiered memory system:
1. **Short-term memory**: Represented by `ConversationHistory` in the Ollama client, which maintains recent conversation context
2. **Long-term memory**: Implemented through `CommandHistory` with persistent storage in the terminal emulator, which saves command history to disk

## 3. Current Implementation (The "How")

### 3.1 Core Terminal Functionality
The terminal emulator uses `portable_pty` for cross-platform PTY execution, with components for:
- Command execution in a pseudo-terminal environment
- State management of command blocks with statuses (Editing, Running, Success, Failed, Cancelled, TimedOut)
- Persistent command history storage using JSON format
- Tab completion for file paths
- History navigation with arrow keys

### 3.2 Modern UI Features
The terminal UI implements several modern features:
- Pane management with horizontal and vertical splits
- Tab management for organizing workspaces
- Command blocks with visual status indicators
- Theme system with customizable color schemes
- Command palette with fuzzy search
- Confirmation dialogs for critical actions
- Scrollable content areas with Page Up/Down navigation

### 3.3 Local AI Integration
The Ollama client provides:
- Communication with local Ollama service
- Streaming responses for real-time interaction
- Conversation history management
- Data models for requests and responses

However, the current implementation has some limitations:
- AI command processing in the terminal UI is simulated rather than fully implemented
- Ollama integration in the MCP server is currently mocked

### 3.4 Framework Usage
The project uses the Elysia framework concepts but is implemented in Rust:
- Event-driven architecture with async/await for handling user input and command execution
- Component-based UI with separate modules for layout, theme, and widgets
- JSON-RPC for MCP server implementation

## 4. Spec-Kit Alignment

### 4.1 Specification Coverage
The project has comprehensive specifications in `specs/ai-terminal-v2/`:
- `spec.md`: Detailed technical specification covering project structure, components, required tools, functional requirements, and success criteria
- `plan.md`: Implementation plan with 6 phases over 16 weeks
- `tasks.md`: Detailed task list with specific items for each phase

### 4.2 Implementation Status
The current implementation aligns well with the specifications:
- Core terminal infrastructure (Phase 1) is largely complete
- Modern UI features (Phase 2) are partially implemented with pane and tab management
- Enhanced UI/UX features (Phase 3) are partially implemented with theme system and widgets
- Ollama integration (Phase 4) is partially implemented with basic client functionality
- Session management and configuration (Phase 5) are partially implemented
- Testing and refinement (Phase 6) has some unit tests but lacks comprehensive coverage

### 4.3 Discrepancies
Several discrepancies exist between the specifications and implementation:
- AI command processing is not fully implemented in the terminal UI
- MCP server implementation for Ollama tools is currently mocked
- Some planned UI features like session management are not yet implemented
- Comprehensive testing as outlined in Phase 6 is incomplete
