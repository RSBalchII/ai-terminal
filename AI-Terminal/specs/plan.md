# AI-Terminal Technical Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the technical approach for implementing the AI-Terminal project, including the technology stack, architecture, and data models.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

1. **Language**: Rust
   - Chosen for its performance, memory safety, and growing ecosystem
   - Well-suited for system-level applications like terminals

2. **UI Framework**: Tauri
   - Provides a lightweight, native desktop application experience
   - Uses the OS's native web renderer for optimal performance
   - Allows for a modern UI while maintaining small application size
   - Enables deep system integration through its Rust backend

3. **Terminal UI Library**: ratatui
   - Rust library for creating terminal user interfaces
   - Provides the text-based UI components for the terminal experience
   - Offers flexibility in designing the block-based I/O interface

4. **Local IPC**: Unix Domain Sockets
   - Most efficient option for local inter-process communication
   - Minimal overhead for communication between Rust terminal and Python ECE
   - Well-supported in both Rust and Python

### Supporting Technologies

1. **Python** (for ECE service)
   - Rich ecosystem for AI/ML libraries
   - Mature frameworks for service implementation
   - Strong integration capabilities with various AI models

2. **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)**
   - Efficient serialization for IPC communication
   - Strong typing for request/response models
   - Good cross-language support

3. **WebView Technologies**
   - For rendering rich UI elements within the terminal
   - Leveraging OS-native web rendering capabilities

## Software Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The AI-Terminal application consists of three main components:

1. **Terminal Frontend** (Rust + Tauri + ratatui)
   - Provides the user interface and terminal experience
   - Handles user input and displays output in blocks
   - Manages the integrated text editor
   - Communicates with the ECE via local IPC

2. **Execution Control Engine (ECE)** (Python)
   - Processes AI requests and generates responses
   - Interfaces with various AI models
   - Manages context and session state
   - Executes approved commands

3. **Local IPC Layer**
   - Facilitates communication between Terminal Frontend and ECE
   - Uses Unix Domain Sockets for efficient local communication
   - Implements request/response protocol with status updates

### Component Interactions

|                  |        |  Sockets)     |        |                 |
+------------------+        +---------------+        +-----------------+
```

### Terminal Frontend Structure

1. **UI Manager**
   - Handles rendering of the terminal interface
   - Manages block-based I/O display
   - Controls the integrated text editor

2. **Command Processor**
   - Processes user input commands
   - Executes shell commands
   - Formats and displays command output

3. **AI Interface**
   - Handles natural language prompts
   - Displays AI responses
   - Manages context for AI interactions

4. **IPC Client**
   - Connects to ECE via Unix Domain Sockets
   - Sends requests and receives responses
   - Handles connection errors and recovery

### Execution Control Engine Structure

1. **Request Handler**
   - Receives requests from Terminal Frontend
   - Parses and validates request payloads
   - Routes requests to appropriate processors

2. **AI Orchestrator**
   - Interfaces with multiple AI models
   - Manages context and session state
   - Combines responses from different models

3. **Command Executor**
   - Executes approved commands
   - Monitors long-running processes
   - Provides status updates

4. **IPC Server**
   - Listens for connections on Unix Domain Socket
   - Handles request/response communication
   - Manages connection state

## Data Models

### Request Model

```protobuf
message AIRequest {
  string id = 1;
  string prompt = 2;
  Context context = 3;
  repeated Attachment attachments = 4;
  map<string, string> metadata = 5;
}

message Context {
  string project_path = 1;
  string current_directory = 2;
  repeated CommandHistory history = 3;
  string session_id = 4;
}

message CommandHistory {
  string command = 1;
  string output = 2;
  int64 timestamp = 3;
}

message Attachment {
  oneof content {
    string file_path = 1;
    string url = 2;
    bytes image_data = 3;
  }
  string name = 4;
}
```

### Response Model

```protobuf
message AIResponse {
  string request_id = 1;
  oneof content {
    string text_response = 2;
    CodeBlock code_response = 3;
    DiffResponse diff_response = 4;
  }
  repeated Suggestion suggestions = 5;
  Status status = 6;
}

message CodeBlock {
  string language = 1;
  string code = 2;
  bool executable = 3;
}

message DiffResponse {
  string file_path = 1;
  string original_content = 2;
  string modified_content = 3;
}

message Suggestion {
  string id = 1;
  string title = 2;
  string description = 3;
}

enum Status {
  PROCESSING = 0;
  COMPLETED = 1;
  ERROR = 2;
}
```

### Status Update Model

```protobuf
message StatusUpdate {
  string request_id = 1;
  string message = 2;
  double progress = 3;  // 0.0 to 1.0
  Status status = 4;
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Local Communication Only**: All IPC communication happens locally via Unix Domain Sockets
2. **User Approval**: AI-generated commands require explicit user approval before execution
3. **Data Isolation**: Project data remains local and is not transmitted to external services without user consent
4. **Secure Defaults**: Configuration defaults prioritize security and privacy

## Performance Considerations

1. **Efficient IPC**: Unix Domain Sockets provide low-overhead communication
2. **Memory Safety**: Rust's memory safety model prevents common performance issues
3. **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking operations for responsive UI
4. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of processes and connections
