# AI-Terminal Specification

## Overview

AI-Terminal is a local-first, Rust-based terminal application inspired by Warp, designed to provide developers with an AI-enhanced command-line experience. The terminal combines traditional command-line functionality with modern UI elements and AI capabilities to streamline development workflows.

## User Stories

### Core User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to execute commands in a terminal interface so that I can interact with my system and development tools.

2. **As a developer**, I want to see command output in distinct blocks so that I can easily distinguish between different command executions and their outputs.

3. **As a developer**, I want to edit code directly in the terminal using a modern text editor so that I don't need to switch between applications for simple edits.

4. **As a developer**, I want to send natural language prompts to an AI assistant so that I can get help with coding tasks, debugging, and system operations.

5. **As a developer**, I want to attach files, URLs, and images to my AI prompts so that I can provide rich context for complex tasks.

6. **As a developer**, I want to review and refine AI-generated code before execution so that I can maintain control over my development environment.

7. **As a developer**, I want to configure AI behavior through project-specific settings so that I can tailor the assistant to my project's needs.

8. **As a developer**, I want to maintain local data control so that my code and commands are not sent to external servers without my knowledge.

### Advanced User Stories

9. **As a developer**, I want to chain commands together with AI assistance so that I can create complex workflows with natural language.

10. **As a developer**, I want to visualize diffs and changes proposed by the AI so that I can understand the impact of suggested modifications.

11. **As a developer**, I want to integrate with external tools and services through the AI assistant so that I can access information from my development ecosystem.

12. **As a developer**, I want to monitor long-running processes with visual indicators so that I can track progress without constant manual checking.

## Functional Requirements

### Terminal Core

1. **Text-based Interface**: Provide a traditional terminal interface for executing shell commands
2. **Block-based I/O**: Display command input and output in distinct visual blocks
3. **Command History**: Maintain history of executed commands with easy navigation
4. **Tab Completion**: Support tab completion for commands, file paths, and options
5. **Syntax Highlighting**: Apply syntax highlighting to command output when appropriate

### Modern UI Features

1. **Integrated Editor**: Include a lightweight text editor for file modifications
2. **Rich Context Inputs**: Support file attachments, URL references, and image uploads
3. **Visual Diff Review**: Display code changes with visual diff capabilities
4. **Progress Indicators**: Show visual indicators for long-running processes
5. **Customizable Themes**: Allow customization of color schemes and visual elements

### AI Integration

1. **Natural Language Prompts**: Accept natural language prompts for AI assistance
2. **Code Generation**: Generate executable code snippets based on prompts
3. **Context Awareness**: Maintain context of current project and session
4. **Multi-Model Support**: Interface with multiple AI models simultaneously
5. **Local Execution Control**: Execute AI-generated commands only with explicit user approval

### ECE (Execution Control Engine) Communication

1. **Local IPC**: Communicate with a Python-based ECE service via local IPC
2. **Request/Response Model**: Send structured requests and receive responses from the ECE
3. **Status Updates**: Receive real-time status updates from long-running ECE operations
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle ECE communication failures
5. **Security**: Ensure all communication is secure and local

### Configuration

1. **Project Settings**: Support project-specific configuration files
2. **User Preferences**: Maintain user-specific preferences and settings
3. **AI Behavior Control**: Allow configuration of AI assistant behavior and constraints
4. **Key Bindings**: Support customizable key bindings for common operations

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: Maintain responsive interface even during intensive operations
2. **Security**: Ensure all local data remains on the user's machine
3. **Reliability**: Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
4. **Cross-Platform**: Support major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
5. **Extensibility**: Design architecture to support future feature additions
