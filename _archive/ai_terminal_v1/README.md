# AI-Powered Terminal

This project aims to build a next-generation command-line interface in Rust, designed for performance, safety, and deep integration with local Large Language Models (LLMs) via Ollama. Inspired by the Warp terminal, this application prioritizes ergonomics, speed, and AI-native features to create an integrated development environment for the terminal.

## Goals

*   Architect and build a modern, AI-powered terminal application in Rust.
*   Achieve feature parity with the core functionalities of the Warp terminal.
*   Integrate Ollama to provide powerful, local-first AI capabilities.
*   Ensure the final product is polished, performant, and extensible.

## Setup and Running

*(Instructions for setting up the development environment and running the application will be added here.)*

## Core Components

*(A high-level overview of the main components will be added here, with detailed explanations in `current-state-analysis.md`.)*
