# AI Terminal Implementation Report

## Overview

This report details the implementation of the `ollama-client` crate and its integration with the existing AI Terminal application. The implementation enables the terminal to communicate with the Ollama API for AI-powered responses while maintaining the existing shell command functionality.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. New `ollama-client` Crate

A new Rust crate `ollama-client` was created to handle all communication with the Ollama API. This crate is designed to be reusable and follows Rust best practices.

#### Key Components:

- **API Models**: Defined data structures for Ollama API requests (`OllamaRequest`) and responses (`OllamaResponse`) based on the Ollama API documentation.
- **OllamaClient**: The main client struct that handles sending requests to the Ollama API and processing streaming responses.
- **ConversationHistory**: A module for managing conversation history with context-aware interactions.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with custom error types for different failure modes.

#### Features:

- **Streaming Responses**: The client properly handles streaming responses from the Ollama API, processing them line by line.
- **Environment Configuration**: The client reads the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable to determine the API endpoint, with a default fallback.
- **Context Management**: The conversation history module maintains context between user and assistant messages for more coherent conversations.

### 2. Integration with `terminal-ui`

The `ollama-client` crate was integrated with the existing `terminal-ui` crate to enable AI-powered responses within the terminal interface.

#### Key Changes:

- **Command Processing**: Modified the input handling to differentiate between regular shell commands and AI commands (prefixed with '/').
- **AI Command Handling**: Added a new function `process_ai_command` that sends user input to the Ollama API and displays the streaming response in real-time.
- **Conversation History**: Integrated the conversation history management to maintain context between user and AI interactions.

### 3. Testing

Comprehensive tests were written for the `ollama-client` crate to ensure its reliability and correctness.

#### Test Coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: Tests for the conversation history management functionality.
- **Integration Tests**: Tests for the Ollama client's API interaction, including successful requests and error handling.
- **Mock Server**: Used the `wiremock` crate to create mock Ollama API endpoints for testing without requiring a running Ollama instance.

## Technical Details

### Ollama API Communication

The `OllamaClient` uses the `reqwest` crate to send HTTP POST requests to the Ollama API's `/generate` endpoint. It properly handles streaming responses by:

1. Reading the response as a stream of bytes
2. Converting bytes to UTF-8 strings
3. Processing complete JSON lines terminated by newlines
4. Deserializing JSON into `OllamaResponse` structs
5. Handling any remaining data in the buffer after the stream ends

### Conversation Context

The `ConversationHistory` module maintains a history of user and assistant messages. When sending a new request to the Ollama API, the client includes the context from the last assistant message to maintain conversation continuity.

### Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for various failure modes:

- Network errors
- JSON serialization/deserialization errors
- Invalid API responses
- Missing environment variables

## Usage

To use the AI functionality in the terminal:

1. Start the AI Terminal application
2. Type a regular shell command and press Enter to execute it as usual
3. Type an AI command by prefixing it with '/', e.g., `/What is the weather like today?` and press Enter
4. The AI response will be displayed in the terminal as it is received from the Ollama API

## Future Improvements

1. **Model Selection**: Allow users to select different Ollama models for different tasks
2. **System Prompts**: Add support for custom system prompts to guide the AI's behavior
3. **Response Formatting**: Implement better formatting for AI responses, including code blocks
4. **Command History**: Add AI commands to the command history for easy recall
5. **Configuration File**: Add a configuration file for persistent settings
