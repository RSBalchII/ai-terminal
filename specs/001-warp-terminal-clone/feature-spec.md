# Feature Specification: Warp Terminal Clone with Local LLMs

**Feature Branch**: `001-warp-terminal-clone`  
**Created**: 2025-09-03  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Input**: User description: "I want this app to be as close to the warp terminal as possible but just allows me to use local llm models. Otherwise the way warp terminal works now is perfect"

## Approved Decisions (2025-09-04)
- Primary UX: GUI-first using egui; retain Chat mode, add Terminal mode (Warp-like blocks)
- Terminal engine: Use existing terminal-emulator crate (PTY + CommandBlock + History)
- AI: Local-only via Ollama (localhost:11434); no cloud calls
- Persistence: SQLite-based terminal history/sessions in the next phase
- Security posture: Local-only, permissive defaults (dangerous operations allowed) with guardrails and optional confirmations

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse Warp Terminal core features
   ‚Üí Identify: AI integration, command blocks, workflows, notebooks
2. Map features to local LLM implementation
   ‚Üí Replace cloud AI with Ollama/local models
3. Define user interactions matching Warp
   ‚Üí Command blocks, AI assistance, workflow sharing
4. Establish visual/UX requirements
   ‚Üí Match Warp's modern terminal aesthetic
5. Identify data persistence needs
   ‚Üí History, workflows, notebooks, settings
6. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Verify all Warp-like features covered
7. Align with Brownfield findings (specs/current-state-analysis.md)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on replicating Warp Terminal user experience
- ‚úÖ Use local LLM models instead of cloud AI
- ‚ùå No cloud dependencies or external API calls
- üë• Target developers who want Warp features with privacy/local control
- üß≠ Start with GUI Terminal mode + PTY integration, then enable persistence

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want a modern terminal experience like Warp that uses local LLM models, so I can have AI-assisted command line interactions without sending data to the cloud, while maintaining all the productivity features that make Warp excellent.

### Core Warp Features to Replicate

#### 1. **Command Blocks**
- Each command and its output forms a discrete, selectable block
- Users can navigate between blocks with keyboard shortcuts
- Blocks can be copied, shared, or saved to notebooks
- Failed commands are visually distinct with error highlighting

#### 2. **AI Command Assistance**
- Natural language to command translation (e.g., "show me large files" ‚Üí `find . -size +100M`)
- Command explanation on demand (e.g., shortcut while a block or input is focused)
- Inline AI suggestions while typing
- Error explanation and fix suggestions
- All powered by local LLMs (Ollama)

#### 3. **Warp Notebooks (Workflows)**
- Save sequences of commands as reusable notebooks
- Share notebooks with team (via files, not cloud)
- Parameterize commands with variables
- Run entire notebooks or individual commands

#### 4. **Modern Text Editing**
- Full text editor capabilities in command input
- Multi-line editing with proper cursor movement (Shift+Enter for newline)
- Syntax highlighting for commands
- Auto-completion for commands, paths, and flags

#### 5. **Visual Design**
- Clean, modern interface (not traditional terminal aesthetic)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Theme support (dark/light modes minimum)
- Clear visual hierarchy with proper spacing

### Acceptance Scenarios (Phase 1: GUI Terminal)
1. Given the user opens Terminal mode, when they run a command, then a block appears with status (running/success/failure), timestamp, exit code, and collapsible output.
2. Given multiple executed commands, when the user presses Ctrl+Up/Down, then focus moves between blocks.
3. Given a long output, when the user scrolls, then the history remains responsive and readable.
4. Given a command finishes, when the user copies the block, then both command and output are copied.
5. Given the user changes directory with cd, when they run a subsequent command, then it executes in the new working directory.

### Acceptance Scenarios (Phase 2: Persistence)
1. Given the user has executed blocks, when they restart the app, then the last session loads automatically (if enabled).
2. Given multiple sessions are saved, when selecting a session in the UI, then the terminal history is restored.
3. Given the user exports a session, when they import it elsewhere, then blocks appear identically (command, output, metadata).

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the local LLM is unavailable? ‚Üí Graceful degradation to standard terminal
- How does system handle very long command outputs? ‚Üí Virtualized scrolling with block collapsing
- What if multiple LLM requests queue up? ‚Üí Priority queue with cancellation
- How are sensitive commands handled? ‚Üí Warning dialogs (optional) and guardrails for destructive operations

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Terminal Features
- **FR-001**: System MUST render each command and its output as a discrete, selectable block
- **FR-002**: System MUST support keyboard navigation between command blocks (Ctrl+Up/Down)
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow copying individual blocks or selections
- **FR-004**: System SHOULD provide syntax highlighting for shell commands (phase-aligned)
- **FR-005**: System MUST support multi-line command editing with text editor features
- **FR-006**: System MUST reflect current working directory and support cd changes

#### AI Integration
- **FR-007**: System MUST translate natural language queries to shell commands using local LLMs
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide command explanations on demand
- **FR-009**: System MUST suggest command completions using AI context
- **FR-010**: System MUST explain errors and suggest fixes using local LLMs
- **FR-011**: System MUST work exclusively with local models (no cloud API calls)

#### Persistence
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist command blocks and sessions locally (SQLite)
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide session selection and auto-load last session
- **FR-014**: System SHOULD support export/import of sessions (JSON/YAML)
