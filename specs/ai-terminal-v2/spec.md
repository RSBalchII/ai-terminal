# AI-Terminal Project Specification

## 1. Overview
The AI-Terminal is a revolutionary local-first terminal interface inspired by Zellij and Warp Terminal, functioning as an "Externalized Executive Function" for human users. It serves as a "Personal Pauline" - a genuine partner in cognitive and creative processes - while incorporating modern terminal features like panes, tabs, and AI-powered assistance.

This document outlines the technical specification for the AI-Terminal application, focusing on its structure as a Rust-based terminal interface with integrated local AI capabilities through Ollama.

## 2. Core Philosophy
The AI-Terminal embodies the vision of human-AI symbiosis with a strong emphasis on local-first principles:
- It serves as an "honest mirror" reflecting the user's intentions and actions
- It acts as a "cockpit" for the External Context Engine (ECE)
- It functions as an "Externalized Executive Function" augmenting human cognitive capabilities
- It maintains a "Living Narrative" of the user's journey and interactions
- It provides an enhanced user experience inspired by modern terminals like Warp
- It prioritizes user privacy and data ownership through local-first design

## 4. Core Components

### 4.1 Main Application (`ai-terminal`)
The main application orchestrates the terminal interface, local AI integration, and user interaction.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Application entry point and initialization
- Integration of terminal UI with local AI capabilities
- MCP client management for connecting to local AI tools
- Command routing between traditional execution and AI assistance

### 4.2 Terminal Emulator (`terminal-emulator`)
Handles command execution, history management, and process control.

**Key Components:**
- `PtyExecutor`: Executes commands in a pseudo-terminal environment
- `CommandBlock`: Represents individual command executions with state management
- `CommandHistory`: Manages command history with persistence

### 4.3 Terminal UI (`terminal-ui`)
Provides the visual interface and user interaction components, inspired by Zellij and Warp.

**Key Components:**
- `TerminalSession`: Manages the overall terminal session
- Layout management for responsive UI with panes and tabs
- Theme system for customization
- Widgets for enhanced interaction (command palette, confirmation dialogs)

### 4.4 Ollama Client (`ollama-client`)
Interfaces with the Ollama API for local AI capabilities.

**Key Components:**
- `OllamaClient`: Handles communication with local Ollama service
- Data models for requests and responses
- Conversation history management
- MCP server implementation for exposing Ollama as local tools
