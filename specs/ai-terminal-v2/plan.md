# Implementation Plan: Coda A-001 (The Architect)
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Status:** Draft
- **Spec Link:** `specs/Coda-A-001/spec.md`
- **Date:** 2025-09-06

## 1. Project Goal
To develop and deploy a specialized generative agent, Coda A-001, capable of authoring high-quality, effective, and aligned POML constitutions for other AI agents within the ECE.

## 2. Development Phases
This project will be executed in four distinct phases, moving from foundational setup to advanced refinement and integration.

### Phase 1: Foundational Persona Implementation
*Goal: Establish the basic operational capability of the A-001 agent.*

- **P1.1: Constitution Finalization:** Formalize the draft `Coda-A-001.poml` file. This document will serve as the agent's own identity and behavioral guide.
- **P1.2: Core Prompt Engineering:** Develop the main system prompt that instructs the LLM on its role as The Architect. This prompt will load the POML's core concepts (`<core_metaphor>`, `<values>`, `<directive>`) into the agent's working context.
- **P1.3: Basic I/O Loop:** Implement a simple conversational interface to interact with the agent, allowing the Prime Architect to send requests and receive generated outputs.

### Phase 2: Core Protocol Development
*Goal: Implement the agent's primary functional capabilities as defined in the specification.*

- **P2.1: Develop `Constitutional_Analysis` Protocol (FR-1, FR-2):**
    - Engineer a chain-of-thought prompt that guides the agent to analyze an initial request and generate relevant, Socratic clarifying questions.
- **P2.2: Develop POML Generation Engine (FR-3):**
    - Create the primary generative prompt that takes a set of clarified requirements and outputs a complete, well-formed POML file.
- **P2.3: Develop `Integrity_Validation` Protocol (FR-4):**
    - Implement a two-step "Generate & Review" process.
    - Step 1: The generation engine (P2.2) creates a draft POML.
    - Step 2: A separate "Critic" prompt reviews the draft for logical inconsistencies, conflicting protocols, or vague language before presenting the final output.

### Phase 3: Knowledge Base & Refinement Loop
*Goal: Enable the agent to learn and improve over time.*

- **P3.1: Implement Knowledge Base (FR-5):**
    - Create a structured `knowledge_base.md` file containing examples of effective linguistic patterns, metaphors, and protocol designs.
    - Modify the core prompt to instruct the agent to consult this knowledge base when drafting new POMLs.
- **P3.2: Implement `Iterative_Refinement` Protocol (FR-6):**
    - Develop a prompt that allows the agent to receive natural language feedback on a generated POML (e.g., "Make the values more focused on creativity") and generate a revised version.

### Phase 4: Testing & Integration
*Goal: Verify the agent's effectiveness and integrate it into our standard workflow.*

- **P4.1: Develop Evaluation Suite:** Create a set of test cases, each with a sample persona request and a list of desired outcomes, to benchmark the agent's performance against its success criteria.
- **P4.2: Workflow Integration:** Define the command and process for invoking Coda A-001 from within the primary `AI-Terminal` or development environment.
